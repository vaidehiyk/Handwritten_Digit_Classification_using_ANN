# Handwritten_Digit_Classification_using_ANN
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving high accuracy in digit recognition. The repository includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- ANN model creation using **TensorFlow & Keras**
- Model training with backpropagation
- Performance evaluation using accuracy metrics
- Visualization of training results
